### Important

When setting a `custom_id` (only if you want to make a view persistent), make sure to follow the following rules:

1. Start with the type of the view (`button`, `modal`) and a semicolon
2. Add the name of the view
3. Add a dot and the name of the item (`button`, `TextInput`) if one exists

Example

`type:viewname.buttonname`
